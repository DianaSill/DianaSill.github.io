## My Portfolio


My portfolio website is a showcase of my journey and skills as a beginner full-stack developer. 
It features a modern, clean design with a focus on simplicity and usability. 

To bring the site to life, I started by designing the layout and visual elements in Figma. This allowed me to create a cohesive and visually appealing design before diving into the code. I then translated the design into a responsive and accessible website using HTML and CSS.


### The site is organized into several key sections:

**Home Page**: 

<br>The landing page introduces who I am and my role as an beginner level full-stack developer.   
It includes easy navigation to different parts of the site and links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and downloadable resume.</br>

**About Me**: 

<br>This section provides a deeper insight into my background, how I got into programming, and what drives my passion for development. It's a brief story of my transition into tech and the various resources I've used to build my skills.</br>

**Projects**: 

<br>Here, I have an area dedicated to projects with brief descriptions of each, also showing the tech stack used.   
This gives a snapshot of my coding abilities and the types of applications I've created.</br>

**Get in Contact**: 
<br>This section invites visitors to connect with me. Whether it's for job opportunities, collaborations, or just networking, I’ve made it easy to reach out via email or social media.</br>


Throughout the site, I’ve incorporated subtle animations and a consistent color scheme to enhance the user experience. The goal was to create a professional yet personal space that reflects both my technical skills and my personality.
